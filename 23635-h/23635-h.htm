<h2>NOTE.</h2>


<p>The following pages constitute an Essay read
before the Numismatic and Antiquarian Society
of Philadelphia in January 1868. It was intended
for publication in the second volume of
the Transactions of the Society, but as the appearance
of this volume has been unexpectedly
delayed, it has been thought best to allow the
Essay to appear separately.</p>

<h2><b>WAMPUM.</b></h2>


<p>When Columbus, on his second voyage to the
New World, landed upon Cape Cabron, Cuba,
the cacique of the adjacent country meeting him
upon the shore offered him a string of beads made
of the hard parts of shells as an assurance of welcome.
Similar gifts were often made to the
great discoverer, whenever the natives sought to
win his favor or wished to assure him of their
own good will. These shell beads were afterwards
found to be in general use among the
tribes of the Atlantic coast. At the close of the
sixteenth century the English colonists found
them in Virginia, as did the Dutch at the commencement
of the following century in New
York, the English in New England and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
French in Canada. The pre-historic inhabitants
of the Mississippi valley were also evidently
acquainted with their manufacture, as remains of
shell beads have been found in many of the
mounds which survive as the only memorials of
that mysterious people.</p>

<p>These Indian beads were known under a
variety of names among the early colonists, and
were called, <i>wampum</i>, <i>wampom-peage</i>, or <i>wampeage</i>,
frequently <i>peage</i> or <i>peake</i> only, and in some localities
<i>sewan</i> or <i>zewand</i>. But generally sewan prevailed
among the Dutch, and wampum among
the English. These names were applied without
distinction to all varieties of beads. This confusion
arose naturally enough from the scanty
acquaintance of the whites with the Indian language.
The word wampum [wompam],<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
has since become a general term, was restricted
by the Indians to the white beads. It was derived
from <i>wompi</i>, "white." The other or dark beads
were called <i>suck&aacute;uhock</i>, a name compounded of
<i>s&uacute;cki</i>, "dark colored," and <i>hock</i>, "shell." The
name <i>Mowhakes</i>, compounded of <i>mowi</i>, "black,"
and <i>hock</i>, "shell," was also sometimes applied to
the dark beads. It thus appears that the Indians
divided their beads into two general classes, the
<i>wompam</i>, or white beads, and <i>suck&aacute;uhock</i>, or dark
beads. Both white and black consisted of highly
polished, testaceous cylinders, about one-eighth of
an inch in diameter and a quarter of an inch long,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
drilled length-wise and strung upon fibres of hemp
or the tendons of wild beasts. <i>Suck&aacute;uhock</i> was
made from the stem of the <i>Venus mercenaria</i>,
or common round clam, popularly known as the
quauhaug; <i>wampum</i> from the column and inner
whorls of the <i>Pyrula carica</i> and <i>Pyrula caniculata</i><a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
[Lam.], species known as Winkles or Periwinkles
among fishermen, and the largest convoluted shells<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
of our New England coast.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> These shells were
found in great abundance along the sea shore,
lying either upon the mud, or just beneath the
surface, and were wrought in the following
manner. The desirable portions of the shells
were first broken out into small pieces of the form
of a parallelopiped; these were then drilled and
afterwards ground and polished. Possessing no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
better tools, the Indians made shift to bore them
with stone drills,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> implements which hardly correspond
with the delicacy and exactness exhibited
by the specimens of original wampum that have
come down to us. The process of polishing and
shaping was equally painful and laborious, for
rubbing with the hand over a smooth stony
surface, was the only method which the rudeness
of the Aborigines could devise. Yet the finished
beads, whether attached in thick masses to garments,
or strung in long flexible rows, were very
comely and without a trace of the tawdriness,
which is so characteristic of uncivilized peoples.
The suck&aacute;uhock with its varying shades of purple<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
was particularly beautiful. Its value was double
that of the white and the darker its color, the
more highly it was prized. But the laborious
method of production imparted no trivial value
to both varieties.</p>

<p>It seems almost incredible that the Indian
could produce so clever an article with his rude
implements. Some have conjectured that the
specimens produced before the natives obtained
awl blades from the colonists were very inferior
to their later productions. One writer<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> even
goes so far as to suggest, that, before the advent
of Europeans, Indian beads consisted mostly of
small pieces of wood, stained white or black. The
fact is, however, that the manufacture of wampum
dates back at least to the time of the mound
builders, for quantities of beads similar in form
to the more modern article, and proved by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
chemical tests and structural peculiarities to be
similar in material, have been exhumed from the
ancient mounds of the west.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>Other species besides the wampum and suck&aacute;uhock
crept into local use among the different
tribes. The Iroquois in their civil and religious
ceremonies employed a variety named <i>otek&oacute;a</i>, and
made from spiral fresh water shells of the genus
<i>unio</i>. This as may be inferred from its uses was
held in the highest esteem, and no other could be
employed in the different stages of the ceremonial.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
In New England and perhaps elsewhere,
an inferior kind made evidently from shells too
small and thin to be wrought into the cylindrical
beads, circulated to a limited extent. The separate
pieces were round and flat, about an eighth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
of an inch broad and a sixteenth of an inch
thick, white and black were strung alternately,
but the strings, though arranged with considerable
nicety, lacked wholly the finish and flexibility
of the regular article. In Virginia <i>roenoke</i> was
current. This consisted of small rough fragments
of cockle shells, which were drilled and
strung. The last two varieties were only used to
a limited extent, even in the region of their
manufacture. Here, as elsewhere, the cylindrical
wampum was the standard, and the dearest to the
Indian of all his treasures. Indeed such was the
value set upon it, that attempts were often made
to counterfeit it, an unallowed shell being fraudulently
used in the manufacture of the white,
while the black was imitated from a kind of
stone. Yet the habitual caution and keenness of
the Indian made it difficult to palm off the spurious
article upon him.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>
<p>As wampum was made from marine shells,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> it
was naturally manufactured by the sea shore
tribes, and in localities determined by the abundance
of raw material. Here the shells were
stored up in some convenient spot during summer,
to be worked out in winter when the rigors
of the season should deter the men from their
ordinary out door pursuits.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Probably but little
was produced north of the Narragansetts [Rhode
Island], as the necessary shells were scarce beyond
Cape Cod. The Narragansetts were themselves
great producers, and tradition claimed for their
tribe the honor of the invention of wampum.
But the Long Island Indians were by far the
greatest producers along our northern coast. Their
sandy flats and marshes teemed with sea life, and,
when the Dutch first came to New Amsterdam,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
their island went by the name of <i>sewan hacky</i>, or
the "land of the sewan shell," so numerous were
the sewan manufactories upon it. Without doubt
production was stimulated beyond its natural limits
by the demand from powerful tribes from the
main land, who found it easier to exact wampum
as tribute from their weak neighbors, than personally
to engage in its laborious coinage. Hazard,
in his collection of state papers, states, that the
Narragansetts frequently compelled large tributes
in wampum from the Long Island Indians. The
Pequots also for many years prior to 1637, exacted
large annual contributions from the same
tribes while they were still further subject to the
levies of the imperious Mohawks. Thus the
mint of wealth at their very doors became to its
possessors the source of untold misery. Constant
fear kept them toiling at the mines, while the
scanty proceeds of their labor only quickened the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
greed of their savage masters. The number and
extent of the sewan manufactories upon Long
Island may be inferred from the frequent and
immense shell heaps left by the Indians in all of
which scarcely a whole shell is to be found.
Occasionally the whole shells were carried over
to the main land and there wrought. From
Sewan-Hacky down the Atlantic coast and along
the gulf, the shaded covers and quiet banks were
doubtless dotted with wampum manufactories,
for there was a great demand constantly to be
met.</p>

<p>The inland tribes were of course unable to produce
their own wampum, and depended for their
supply upon the coast tribes. A brisk trade thus
arose between the coast and interior. Hides and
furs were brought down to clothe the denser
population of the shore, and wampum carried<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
back in exchange.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Often, however, the inland
tribes were able to pounce down and wring this
precious material from its carriers in the form of
tribute.</p>

<p>Wampum is often spoken of as "Indian money."
This expression if referring to colonial times is
perfectly proper, but must be received with caution
in the consideration of ante-colonial days.
The barbarian, dwelling in independent isolation,
satisfies the majority of his wants by direct effort
and not by an interchange of services, nor till
civilization has considerably advanced can we look
for any general system of exchanges with the
mutual dependence and mutual benefits which
such a system involves. So attractive an article
as wampum was doubtless eagerly sought in
barter, and would readily procure for its possessor
whatever else he might desire. Indeed we know<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
that it was the means of an extensive trade between
the coast and the interior, the inland
Indians bringing down hides and furs to be exchanged
for the wampum of the shore. All this,
however, was in the way of barter, and we cannot
hence infer that the idea of a medium or money
crept into the limited circle of the redman's wants
and satisfactions. His circumstances did not demand
and would not therefore suggest it. Wampum
was the gold of the aborigine. But he
had yet to learn that the value of gold resides not
alone in its glitter. The ancient Peruvians dwelt
amid mountains of gold, but the idea of a circulating
medium never dawned upon them. In
like manner, the Indian had never learned that
use of his golden wampum which was the first
to suggest itself to the white man. He made
and valued it for other purposes.</p>

<p>A fondness for personal display and decoration<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
are characteristic of uncivilized life, and wampum
was well adapted to satisfy this weakness of the
Indian. It was every where used for adornment
of the person. The humblest proudly wore his
trifle, while the more favored ones were wont to
decorate themselves in countless gay and fantastic
ways. It was oftenest worn about the neck in
strings of the length of a rosary, the number of
strings being determined by the means or social
position of the wearer.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Bracelets and necklaces
were other forms in which it was frequently displayed.
With the females, head-dresses, consisting
of bands of wampum twined about the
head and gathering up their abundant tresses,
were an especial delight. A border of beads
greatly enhanced the value of any garment, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
outer clothing was usually thus ornamented.
Indeed the wealthy and powerful wore cloaks, as
also aprons and caps, thickly studded with wampum
wrought into various fantastic forms and
figures. Says that old voyager, John Josselyn,
"Prince Phillip, a little before I came to England
[1671], coming to Boston, had on a coat
and buskins thick set with these beads in pleasant
wild works." The moccasin was also, as at the
present day, the recipient of much taste and skill.</p>

<p>More of a luxury and confined mostly to
sachems and sagamores was the wampum belt,
alternate white and purple strings attached in rows
to a deerskin base, and worn as a belt about the
waist, or thrown over the shoulders like a scarf.
Ordinary belts consisted of twelve rows of one
hundred and eighty beads each, but they increased
in length and breadth with the social importance
of the wearer. As many as ten thousand beads are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
known to have been wrought into a single war
belt four inches wide. The regular alternation
of white and purple rows was not always adopted,
but birds and beasts and such other rustic fantasies
as suited the owner's taste, were often interwoven
with the different colors. One of King Philip's
belts surrendered by the Sagamore Annawon to
Capt. Church, was nine inches wide, of sufficient
length when placed about Capt. Church's
shoulders to reach to his ancles, and curiously
inwrought with figures of birds, beasts and flowers.
From another belt of no less exquisite workmanship
and designed to be worn about the head,
two flags fell in graceful folds upon the shoulders.
A third and smaller one had a star embroidered
upon its end, and was to be worn upon the breast.
The haughty old chief was wont to adorn his
person with these insignia when he sat in state
among his subjects. They symbolized, by striking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
emblems, his might and prowess, and kindled in
beholders feelings and emotions that royal pomp
and purple could not awake. The idea of gaudiness
is apt to associate itself in our minds with
Indian trappings, but we must confess that the
simple grace and force of these rustic adornments
would put to shame many a glittering article of
more modern wear.</p>

<p>But wampum strings and belts subserved other
equally important uses. They were among the
Indian race the universal bonds of nations and
individuals, the inviolable and sacred pledges of
word and deed. No promise was binding unless
confirmed by gifts of wampum. The young
warrior declared his passion for his Indian maid,
by presenting wampum chains and belts, and her
acceptance of the proffered present sealed the
marriage compact.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Like tokens accompanied<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
every weighty message, and little reliance was put
upon the messenger who brought not with him
such assurances of good faith.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> They cemented
friendships, confirmed alliances, sealed treaties, and
effectually effaced the memory of injuries.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> A
curious ceremonial had grown up in their presentation
on state occasions. When ambassadors
set out for another nation, they bore before them
the calumet, or pipe of peace, in evidence of their
pacific purpose and to secure protection for their
journey, and also belts of wampum to be submitted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
in confirmation of their proposals, or, if
their people had been worsted in battle to atone
for injuries and purchase peace. In the great
council assembled to receive them, the orator of
the embassy rose and unfolded the object of their
visit, corroborating each important statement and
proposal at its close by laying down wampum
belts. If his words were pleasing, and the presents
taken from the ground in evidence thereof,
similar presents were given in return, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
contract sealed with the smoking of the calumet
and the burial of the hatchet in the midst. Among
the Six Nations, whenever the council failed to
adjust the difficulty or when for any other reason
peace was to be interrupted, war was proclaimed
by striking a tomahawk painted red and ornamented
with black wampum, into the war post
in each village of the league.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>To illustrate what we have said, we subjoin
the following account of an interview between
Sir William Johnson, the noted Indian agent and
the Six Nations, among whom this ceremony
survived even after their decline. "At a meeting
of the Six Nations and their allies at Fort Johnson,
Feb. 18, 1756, Sir William Johnson said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Brethren of the Six Nations</i>,</p>

<p class="p1">I have heard with great concern that a war
party of the Senecas, the most remote nation of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
the confederacy, have had a considerable misunderstanding
with their brethren the English to
the southward, which has been fatal to some of
that nation. I am extremely unable to express
my sorrow for that unhappy affair, and as the
hatchet remains fixed in your heads, I do with
the greatest tenderness and affection remove it
thence.</p>

<p class="rgt">A belt.</p>


<p><i>Brethren</i>,</p>

<p class="p1">With this belt I cleanse and purify the beds of
those who fell in that unfortunate affair from the
defilement they have contracted.</p>

<p class="rgt">A belt.</p>


<p><i>Brethren</i>,</p>

<p class="p1">I am informed that on that occasion you lost
three of your powerful warriors. I do with this
belt cover their dead bodies that they may not
offend our sight any more and bury the whole
affair in oblivion.</p>

<p class="rgt">A belt.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Answer of the Six Nations and their Allies.</span></h3>

<p><i>Brother Warraghiyagey</i>,</p>

<p class="p1">We the sachems and warriors of the Seneca
nation return to you our sincere thanks for your
great affection in drying our tears and driving
sorrow from our hearts, and we in return perform
the same ceremony to you with the like hearty
affection.</p>

<p class="rgt">A string of wampum.</p>


<p><i>Brother Warraghiyagey</i>,</p>

<p class="p1">We are sensible of your goodness expressed to
us in removing the cause of our grief and tenderly
taking the axe out of our heads.</p>

<p class="rgt">A belt.</p>

<p>After several more speeches and presentations
by the Senecas, the other nations in turn presented
belts. In 1748, the general had given them a
large belt upon which was an emblem of the Six
Nations joined hand in hand with the English.
This the speaker then took and said:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>


<p><i>Brother Warraghiyagey</i>,</p>

<p class="p1">Look with all attention on this belt and remember
the solemn and mutual engagements
we entered into when you first took upon you
the management of our affairs. Be assured we
look upon them as sound and shall on our part
punctually perform them as long as we remain a
people.</p>

<p class="rgt">A prodigious large belt.</p>

<p>Taking up another large belt formerly given
them by the governor of New York, he said:</p>


<p><i>Brother Warraghiyagey</i>,</p>

<p class="p1">We hope our brethren, the English, will
seriously remember the promises made us by this
belt and exactly perform them, and we promise
to do the same though we have no record but
our memories.</p>

<p class="rgt">A very large belt."<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>
<p>The belts received at treaties, councils and other
assemblies were entrusted for presentation to the
care of one individual, usually the sachem, who
was expected to keep in mind the occasion and
purport of each, which he could readily do by
the aid of the devices emblematic of the event it
signalized that were traced upon each.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Thus a
belt presented to Sir Wm. Johnson by the Six
Nations, had wrought upon it the sun, the emblem
of light, and symbols of the Six Nations. It
signified that their minds were now illumined by
the clear bright light of truth and their intention
to abide in the light.<a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> In a belt presented at
Easton, His Majesty King George was figured
taking hold of the king of the Six Nations with
one hand, and the king of the Delawares with
the other. A belt presented by the Indians of
Eastern Maine as a pledge of their friendship and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
fidelity to the United States and the king of
France was explained as follows: The belt was
thirteen rows wide to represent the United States,
and had upon it a cross indicating France, and
several white figures denoting the different Indian
villages.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> The Indian like other young languages
drew closer to nature than the dusty abstractions
of civilization. It was highly figurative and the
majority of its words referred directly to familiar
external sights. The tribes of each nation of the
Iroquois were known respectively as the Wolf,
Bear, Beaver, Turtle, Deer, Snipe, Heron and
Hawk. The significant names of chiefs are
known to all, and whoever is familiar with Indian
oratory will readily recollect its garb of bold and
striking metaphors. These features, while imparting
energy to the language, at the same time<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
made it easy to convey its meaning by picture
writing or symbolism, the only mode of writing
which the aborigine possessed.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Thus, too, it
was easy to put upon a belt a few significant
characters which by the principle of mental association
should clearly depict the salient features
of an event or of a series of events. Such belts
carefully preserved served as the annals of a nation.
They were the only authentic history of the past,
recalling the treaties, councils, triumphs and
domestic celebrations of former generations. At
stated times their custodian, the sachem, was
accustomed to gather the younger warriors about
him, and unfolding to them the secrets locked up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
in these mysterious records, instruct them in the
history and engagements of their tribe. The old
soldier's breast glowed with honest pride, as he
recounted to his young braves the exploits of their
sires, or exhibited the proud tokens of submission
forced from some ancient enemy, and most of all
when he came to dwell upon scenes conspicuous
for his own valor and reddened by his blood.
And as the impetuous youths drank in the glorious
story of their father's might and valor on the war
path, there sprang up within them a patriotism
"that grew by what it fed on." In the extensive
confederation of the Iroquois, Hono Wenato, an
Onondaga sachem, was the hereditary keeper of
the wampum. Whenever the grand council met
to fill a vacancy in the sachemship of a tribe of
any nation, it was his duty publicly to repeat to
the new sachem their ancient laws and usages, and
to unfold to him the structure and principles of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
the league, as recorded in the belts committed
to his charge.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>Wampum played an important part in religious
as well as civil ceremonies. On occasions of
great public calamities, it formed the most acceptable
sacrifice that could be offered to the terrible
Hobbamocko, the author of evil, and it entered
largely into the mystic rites of all those weird
assemblies that gathered under the shades of the
forest. When evil threatened or its farther progress
was to be stayed, as also after great triumphs
and abundant harvests, the Indians gathered
from far and near to celebrate their mysteries.
They danced for days, painted and clad in hideous
guise, about a great fire, the throne of the divinity,
and with wild and frantic yells cast from time to
time into the flames furs and weapons, and that
choicest of their treasures the costly wampum.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
Nay it was even whispered in the early time, that
little children gaily adorned with wampum were
led into the midst and thrust into the fiery
embrace of the hissing god.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> The practice of the
Iroquois was less fearful, among whom a string
of white wampum was hung around the neck of
a white dog suspended to a pole and offered as a
sacrifice to the mighty Haweuneyn. The wampum
was a pledge of their sincerity, and white an
emblem of purity and of faith. In the same
nation, previous to "giving thanks to the Maple,"
and their other stated festivals, the people assembled
for the mutual confession of their sins. "The
meeting was opened by one of the 'keepers of the
faith,' with an address upon the propriety and
importance of acknowledging their evil deeds to
strengthen their minds against future temptations.
He then took a string of white wampum in his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
hand, and set the example by a confession of his
own faults, after which he handed the string to
the one nearest to him, who received it, made his
confession in like manner, and passed it to another.
In this way the wampum went around from hand
to hand, and those who had confessions to make,
stated wherein they had done wrong, and promised
to do better in the future. Old and young,
men, women and even children, all united in this
public acknowledgment of their faults, and joined
in the common resolution of amendment. On
some occasions the string of wampum was placed
in the centre of the room, and each one advanced
in turn to perform the duty as the inclination
seized him. A confession and promise without
holding the wampum would be of no avail. It
was the wampum which recorded their words and
gave their pledge of sincerity. The object of
the confession was future amendment."<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p><p>Wampum was the tribute paid by the vanquished
in war, as also the means by which
threatened wars were often averted. The Long
Island Indians for many years paid an annual tribute
to the Pequots, a powerful tribe dwelling in
Eastern Connecticut.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> It is commonly supposed
that these tribes were also tributary to the Six
Nations. To the same great power were subject
the clans between the Hudson and the Connecticut,
and every year two aged but haughty Mohawks
might be seen going from village to village to
collect the tribute that was their due. It is asserted
that as late as 1756, a small tribe near Sugar Loaf
Mountain made an annual payment to this nation
of &pound;20 in wampum. Individual as well as national
obligations were similarly satisfied. Like the
early German, the Indian set a marketable value
on human life, and a suitable present of wampum<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
on the part of the murderer, if accepted, freed
him from the vengeance of the dead man's friends,
for the wampum belt washed away all traces of
the bloody stain.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Perhaps desire for another's
wampum sometimes prompted him to such foul
deeds, as it did the white man,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> though happily
the Indian seldom stooped to theft.</p>

<p>Thus in the rude civilization of the aborigine
wampum filled a space accorded to no one article
in our own. Through life it faithfully met all
his varied wants, and when he came to die, his
friends placed it about his dead body,<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> that it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
might befriend him on his journey to the spirit
land, and on his arrival there gain for him admission
to the realms of the god Kiehtan, the
abode of the blessed.</p>

<p>The shrewd commercial instinct of the Dutch
colonists was quick to profit by wampum in their
dealings with the aborigines. Happily its most
extensive producers dwelt at their very doors.
They obtained from the Long Island tribes in
return for knives, scissors, hatchets and the like,
great quantities of this novel coinage, and then
exchanged it with the Indians of the mainland
for hides and furs, often plunging far into the
interior and drawing thence products which gold
could never have won from their possessors. Did
common trifles fail, wampum was the unfailing
reserve whose charms the savage was powerless to
resist. With such an adjutant trade became
doubly flourishing and lucrative. Posts sprang up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
along the Hudson, in the valley of the Connecticut
and as far south as the Schuylkill, through all of
which ceaseless revenues poured into the coffers
of the Dutch West India Company. Connecticut,
alone, annually furnished to her traders ten thousand
beaver skins.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> In all this traffic wampum
played a leading part, so much so in fact that fur
trade and wampum trade became synonymous
terms.</p>

<p>Toward the close of September, 1627, Isaac
de Rasieres was dispatched from New Amsterdam
on an embassy to the English colony at New
Plymouth. Being of a trading turn, he carried
with him in his vessel among other merchandise
about &pound;50 in wampum which he managed to
dispose of there.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> Wampum was as yet comparatively
unknown in Massachusetts Bay, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
the colonists were ignorant of its uses. This purchase
made with great reluctance, they sent to
their trading house at Kennebeck, where "when
the inland Indians came to know it, they could
scarce procure enough for many years together."
Everywhere in New England, as in the Dutch
provinces, wampum soon became a leading article
in the Indian trade, and added greatly to its profits.
Seven years after its introduction to Kennebeck,
Mr. Winslow carried thence into England about
twenty hogsheads of beaver, "the greater part
whereof was traded for wampampeage" during
the year. By 1636 this trade had grown to such
proportions in Massachusetts colony that the
standing colony were authorized to farm it out
for the increase of the public revenues, and to
establish the severest penalties for any infringement
of the privileges thus granted. The traders
of New England were now ranging the forests in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
all directions and often plunged into them for
hundreds of miles to the great alarm of the Dutch
who feared that the English would monopolize
all the profits of the trade, and that "they should
be obliged to eat oats out of English hands."<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
From the north the French descended in great
numbers, eager to share in the gains of this traffic,
and often encroached upon the domains of other
nations. The solitudes of the wilderness thus resounded
every where to the tread of the adventurous
white man, who, lured on by the hope of
gain, thought not of the dangers that beset his
path. It doubtless afforded the Indian no little
satisfaction to welcome the haughty foreigner to
his wigwam, and while dictating his own terms, to
receive in payment the honored currency of his
fathers. When he took his pay, he measured it
off after his own fashion, the unit being the distance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
from the elbow to the end of the little
finger. According to one authority it made no
difference whether a short or tall man measured
it.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> Adrian Van Tiedhoven, clerk of the court
at the South river, however tells a different story,
complaining bitterly "because the Indians always
take the largest and tallest among them to trade
with us."</p>

<p>But hides and furs were not the only articles
which wampum purchased from the natives. It
was a frequent consideration in early Indian deeds.
In the records of Windsor, Conn., is preserved a
deed, which conveys territory lying between the
Podunk and Scantic rivers, and extending a day's
march into the country, the price paid for which
was fifteen fathoms of wampum and twenty cloth
coats. Most of the present towns of Warwick
and Coventry in Rhode Island, were purchased of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
Miantinomi, sachem of the Narragansetts, for
one hundred and forty-four fathoms of wampum.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>In New England the limits of the trade were
considerably extended by the quantities of wampum
tribute which poured into the hands of the colonial
authorities. Wampum was the commodity
in which tribute was universally paid, and the
stern justice of our fathers imposed this with no
sparing hand upon their weak and erring neighbors.
In 1634, the Pequots were fined 400
fathoms of wampum, and two years afterwards
600 fathoms more.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> After 1637, the Long Island
Indians paid a large yearly tribute to the united
commissioners,<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> as did also the Block Islanders.
It is often difficult, as in the present case, to see
the justice of such exactions. These Indians had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
been guilty of no unfriendly act, and the utmost
urged in extenuation of the imposition was the
flimsy pretence that but for an alleged protection
the same sums would have gone in fealty to their
red brethren. In 1644, the Narragansetts were
fined 2000 fathoms, and doomed to pay yearly
thereafter a fathom for every Pequot man, half
a fathom for every youth and a hand breadth for
every child in the tribe. As late as 1658,<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> the
Pequots were fined ten fathoms a man, and one
of their number imprisoned for offering refuse
wampum in part payment.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> This tribe had
suffered so many and severe exactions that they
were obliged to search in all directions for the
material out of which to manufacture their
wampum, and occasionally crossed over to Long
Island for this purpose. The Montauk sachem<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
fearing that his shores would be exhausted of their
shelly wealth, opposed these visits, until the
Pequots succeeded in securing the interposition
of the united commissioners in their behalf.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
In 1663, the assessment upon this tribe was fixed
at 80 fathoms. Such are a few of the many instances
to be found in the records, showing the
enormous amount of wampum paid as tribute by
the natives to the early authorities of New England.</p>

<p>The Dutch supply was augmented in a different
manner. They soon found the native manufactories
inadequate to the demand and erected mints
of their own, and by introducing steel drills and
polishing lathes won a great advantage over the
original wearisome hand processes. The French
sought a still greater advantage by substituting
porcelain for shells, but the Indians were not to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
be thus easily imposed upon, and the manufacture
of earthen money was soon given up.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> It is
sometimes asserted that the English engaged in
making wampum, though the statement appeared
to be without foundation. The Dutch, however,
produced it in large quantities, and were thereby
enabled to enlarge the circle of their own posts;
and also to furnish liberal supplies to the traders,
north and south, who ranged over the entire
Atlantic coast from the St. Lawrence to the gulf.
In Virginia, the Carolinas, and later in Georgia,
wampum was the chief medium employed in the
fur trade.</p>

<p>The poverty of the early settlers, added to that
short sighted and now obsolete policy of Europe
in the seventeenth century, which jealously
sought to keep all specie within her borders, produced
a general dearth of the precious metals in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
the currency of the New World, and all kinds
of shifts were made to eke out the scanty supply.
Corn, wheat, oats, peas, poultry and the like
sufficed to satisfy any obligation. But then, though
answering well in cases of barter, where two
mutual desires met, were far too bulky and unwieldy
for general use. Naturally then recourse
was had to an article in extensive use among the
traders, and possessing in a measure the portability
of gold and silver, and <i>wampum</i> became a
constituent part of the currency. In one feature
at least, the old civilization held its own beside
the new. As early as 1637, wampum was made
a legal tender in Massachusetts for any sum under
12<i>d.</i>, at the rate of six beads for a penny.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> The
same year it became a legal tender in Connecticut<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
for any amount. The general court declaring
it receivable for taxes "at fousen (4) a penny."<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>But coin grew scarcer in Massachusetts and
shell money increased in value, till in 1640, the
authorities were compelled to adopt the valuation
of Connecticut, ordering that the white pass at
four and the "bleuse" at two a penny, "and not
above 12<i>d.</i> at a time except the receiver desire
more."<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> The public needs soon required another
change, and the legality of shell currency rose to
&pound;10.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> This novel coinage, thus regulated from
time to time, answered well for money throughout
the colonies, till after a while trouble arose
from an unexpected source. The enormous demand
at length brought upon the market beads
of stone or unallowed shells, as also many rough,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
ill-strung specimens of the genuine article. The
disorder was aggravated, because the Indians, who
best understood the qualities of their wampum,
would take only the genuine from the traders,
while the refuse was thrown back into the circulation
of the colonies. The commissioners of the
United Colonies being appealed to for a remedy
recommended to the separate governments to
suppress this poor "peage" by law. Accordingly
in 1648, the general courte of Connecticut
ordered "that no peage, white or black, be paid or
received, but what is strung and in some measure
strung suitably, and not small and great, uncomely
and disorderly mixt, as formerly it hath beene."<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
A similar order was passed in Massachusetts,
where it was further enacted to prepare this
Indian money for ready use, that it be "suitably
strung in eight known parcells, 1<i>d.</i> 3<i>s.</i> 12<i>d.</i> 5<i>s.</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
in white; 2<i>d.</i> 6<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> and 10<i>s.</i> in blacke."<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> Another
favorite length was the fathom, containing
360 beads and current at about 10<i>s.</i> Thus during
these years shell money was current throughout
New-England, and constituted, doubtless, the
best and most convenient portion of the currency.
The government received it for taxes, the farmer
for his produce, the merchant for his wares, and
the laborer for his hire. It formed a frequent
item in the inventories of deceased colonists, being
often the only cash mentioned. It even found
its way into the coffers of Harvard college, for
we read that the lease of the wampum trade in
Massachusetts was attended with the obligation
to take from the college the wampum which it
might have on hand from time to time.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> In the
forest, likewise, it now circulated as money, for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
the Indian was quick to copy the white man's
use of his beads.</p>

<p>Toward the middle of the century wampum
reached its highest value in New-England. Thereafter
the increasing prosperity of the colonies,
the domestic coinage of silver, and perhaps the
too extensive manufacture of the shell money,
gradually diminishing its value, drove it from circulation.
In 1650, it was refused in payment of
country rates in Massachusetts.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> This action of
the government naturally created distrust among
the people, to counteract which it was ordered
that "peage" should still "remagne pawable from
man to man, according to the law in force."
Close upon this followed another decree, limiting
it as a legal tender to 40 shillings.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> These laws
continued in force till 1661, when wampum was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
declared to be no longer a legal tender in Massachusetts.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
Rhode Island passed a similar decree
the next year<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> and Connecticut, probably, soon
afterwards. But though wampum now ceased to
be legally current, it lingered among the people
for years and constituted in great part the small
change of the community. As late as 1704, it
was a common mode of payment in country places.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>Shell money was used extensively and for a long
time in the Dutch colonies. Here for a while
absolutely no coin was in circulation, and wampum
being the feasible substitute was universally adopted.
So great was the popular demand, that even the
unstrung wampum, prohibited in the eastern
colonies, passed at but a trifling discount.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> For<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
many years the easy-going government at New
Amsterdam does not seem to have regulated the
currency by law, as did its more thorough neighbors,
and the amount of wampum requisite to
make a stiver, was left to be determined by the
parties concerned. Such a course was fraught
with inconvenience to the public, and frequent
petitions were made for the establishment of some
uniform rate.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>The rate, however, which obtained by common
consent, was four of the strung and six of the
loose beads for a stiver.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> But in 1641, there
came from foreign parts an inundation of "nasty,
rough" sewan, which drove the better sort out
of circulation, "nay," so runs the record, "threatened
the ruin of the country," and legislation was
imperatively demanded. This inferior article was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
therefore condemned to pass five for a stiver during
the following month, and afterwards six, at
which rate the loose, unstringed wampum, which
served the community as change, subsequently
circulated.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> The importance of wampum during
these years is well illustrated by the fact that the
opulent West India Company in 1664, sought
to negotiate a loan of five or six thousand guilders
in it, wherewith to pay the laboring people, the
obligation to be satisfied with <i>good negroes</i> or other
goods.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> The Dutch succumbed to superior force,
but wampum still held its own. It continued to
be the chief currency not only in New York, but
in the many settlements to the west and south,
which were then under the control of the authorities
at New York. In 1672, the inhabitants of
Hoanskill and New Castle on the Delaware,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
having been plundered by Dutch privateers were
permitted by the government at New York to
lay an impost of four guilders, in wampum, upon
each anker of strong rum imported or sold there.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>
A guilder, which was about six pence currency
or four pence sterling, consisted of twenty stivers,
and eight beads were reckoned equal to one stiver.
As heretofore there was little or no certain coin
in circulation and wampum passed for current
payment in all cases. Indeed the country was so
drained of even this currency by the Indian trade,
that there was difficulty in obtaining a sufficiency.
To remedy this state of affairs, the governor and
council of New York were in 1673 constrained
to issue their proclamation which was published
at Albany, Esopus, Delaware, Long Island and the
adjacent parts, commanding that "instead of
eight white and four black (beads), six white and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
three black should pass for a stiver; and three
times so much the value of silver."<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>The contributions in the churches were for
many years made in wampum, and the first church
on the Jersey shore was built with funds contributed
in this way from Sabbath to Sabbath. As
late as 1683, "the schoolmaster in Flatbush was
paid his salary in wheat, wampum value: He
was bound to provide a basin of water for the
purpose of baptism, for which he received from
the parents or sponsors twelve stivers in wampum."<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>
Nor ten years later had the money of
the aborigines become wholly supplanted by gold
and silver, for we learn that "in 1693, the ferriage
of each single person from New York to
Brooklyn was eight stivers in wampum, or a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
silver two-pence."<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> Further than this we are
unable to trace, though we have good reason to
believe that it circulated, to a limited extent, for
some time thereafter.</p>

<p>Thus while the Indian declined in power his
simple coinage passed from hand to hand, among
his conquerors, in the haunts where unnumbered
generations of his ancestors had trafficked it in
rude barter, or offered it with solemn ceremonial,
their costliest offering, to their country's gods.
It was for about a quarter of a century a legal
tender in New England, while among the Dutch
it was during half a century often the only circulating
medium, and among both Dutch and
English it filled a more or less important part
in the currency for nearly an entire century.</p>

<p>When at length the increasing wealth of the
people drove wampum out of common use, it still<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
remained an important article in commerce. It
was manufactured at New York until the commencement
of the present century to be used in
traffic with the Indians, for whom it had lost
none of its charms, and to be carried by our
whalers into the northern seas.</p>

<p>Treaties and compacts between the different
tribes and the states, and later the general government,
continued to be ratified by the interchange
of wampum belts. The records of the eighteenth
century abound with instances of this character.
The last occasion of the kind is believed to have
been at Prairie du Chien in 1825.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>Among the Indians of the present day wampum
is unknown. The name still remains, but the
trifles to which it is applied bear no resemblance
to the ancient article. The glass beads now<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
current as wampum and the original wampum
are not less unlike, than the squalid Blackfoot of
our western plains, and the proud and imperious
Mohawk, beside his native stream.</p>


<div class="footnotes"><h3>FOOTNOTES:</h3>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> Trumbull in his notes in the Narragansett Club Reprint
of Roger Williams's <i>Key</i>, says: "<i>Wom pam</i> was the name of
the white beads collectively; when strung or wrought in girdles
they constituted <i>wan&ocirc;m-peg</i> [Roger Williams], the <i>wampon-peage</i>
of Wood and other early writers."
</p><p>
<i>Peage</i> or <i>peake</i> signified simply "strung beads," and <i>wampom-peage</i>
accordingly signified "strings of white beads."
</p><p>
The English were doubtless led to consider <i>wampum</i> a
generic word, because they heard it oftenest used, <i>wampum</i>
being much more abundant than <i>suck&aacute;uhock</i>. Their error has
however long since received the sanction of usage. But as far
as our own knowledge extends there was no comprehensive
word for all shell beads in use among the Indians. <i>Sewan</i> had
perhaps very nearly such a use in certain localities, but the real
meaning of the word <i>sewan</i> appears from the following note in
the Narragansett Club Reprint of Roger Williams's <i>Key</i>:&mdash;"<i>Seahwh&oacute;og</i>,
'they are scattered' [Elliot]. From this word
the Dutch traders gave the name of <i>sewared</i> or <i>zeewand</i> [the
participle, <i>seahwh&oacute;un</i>, 'scattered,' 'loose'], to <i>all</i> shell money
just as the English called all <i>peage</i>, or string beads, by the name
of the white or <i>wampom</i>."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> Sometimes from the <i>Buccinum undulatum</i> [M&ouml;ll], found
from Nantucket to Labrador, and occasionally perhaps from the
<i>Natica heros</i> [Say] found from New York to Labrador, and the
<i>Natica duplicata</i> found from Florida to Massachusetts Bay.

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> Many writers have asserted that wampum was worked out
of the inside of the Great Conque shell. This view is evidently
erroneous, as the Great Conque, <i>Strombus gigas</i> [Linn.], is not
found on the Atlantic coast, north of Florida and the West
Indies, except in the fossil state.
</p><p>
The assertion that wampum is an Iroquois word, meaning a
"muscle," is doubtless equally unfounded.
</p><p>
Roger Williams [<i>Key</i>, chap. xxiv], who certainly had
fine opportunities for observation, and our other most trustworthy
authorities, state that the <i>Suck&aacute;uhock</i> was made from the
clam shell, and the <i>wampum</i> from the shells of the Periwinkle,
and such was unquestionably the case.</p></div>

Indians would be received and sold. He said that it would be
sent back to Towattowan, which was a great way to the south,
and was inhabited by a large tribe of Indians. The assembly
resolved that the Indians should be directed to send it back

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
